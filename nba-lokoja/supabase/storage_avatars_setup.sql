-- NBA Lokoja - Avatar Storage Setup
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor as a project admin.

-- 1) Create public bucket for member passport photos
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
values (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  true,
  2097152,
  array['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']
)
on conflict (id) do update
set
  public = excluded.public,
  file_size_limit = excluded.file_size_limit,
  allowed_mime_types = excluded.allowed_mime_types;

-- 2) Storage policies for authenticated users on their own folder: {user_id}/passport-*.ext
-- Read policy (public bucket already exposes public URL, but keep explicit auth read)
drop policy if exists "avatars_public_read" on storage.objects;
create policy "avatars_public_read"
on storage.objects
for select
to public
using (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Upload own file
drop policy if exists "avatars_insert_own" on storage.objects;
create policy "avatars_insert_own"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);

-- Update own file
drop policy if exists "avatars_update_own" on storage.objects;
create policy "avatars_update_own"
on storage.objects
for update
to authenticated

  and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
)
with check (
  bucket_id = 'avatars'
  and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text

-- Delete own file
drop policy if exists "avatars_delete_own" on storage.objects;

for delete
to authenticated
